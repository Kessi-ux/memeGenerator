# Challenge: Add a dark/light mode to the React Facts site
 
Imagine you have been handed this code baese which includes all the design elements for a light to dark mode when the toggle is flipped.

## Advice:
1. Spend a good amount of time looking through the existing code base to make sure you understand how everything is working.

Check the markup starting in index.js -> app.js -> Navbar.js

follow the css classes classNameto the style.css file and make sure you understand how the styles should be applied

Look closely at the conditional className in the JSx to help you decide what kind of props the components need to receive.
